Prompt Book: Building a Free Influencer Shop Platform (with Replit & Codex)

üí° Project Overview

Imagine a platform where social media influencers can open their own online shop for free in minutes. Instead of paying upfront or monthly fees, creators get a personalized storefront (with a unique subdomain like username.platform.com) to sell merchandise, digital downloads, or services to their followers. The platform only earns money by taking a small commission on each sale (e.g. 5-10%), rather than charging influencers a subscription. This model lowers the barrier to entry for creators ‚Äì they can monetize their audience without any upfront cost, and the platform only succeeds when they do. Key aspects of the concept include quick setup, easy product listing, integrated payments, and social media integration, all wrapped in a user-friendly package.

Goals of this Prompt Book: Provide a comprehensive guide to designing and developing this web app from scratch. We will outline the core features, suggest a tech stack, discuss architecture (multi-tenant subdomain approach), and break down a step-by-step development plan. Additionally, since you want to leverage Replit's Ghostwriter (OpenAI Codex) for development, we'll include tips on how to effectively use AI coding assistance at each stage. By the end, you'll have a clear roadmap for building a fully functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the influencer shop platform.

üöÄ Key Features

The platform‚Äôs feature set can be grouped into MVP essentials and nice-to-have enhancements. Below are the core features we aim to implement for the first version:

Free Shop Creation: Influencers can sign up and instantly create a shop at a custom subdomain (e.g., alice.myshop.com). The onboarding will let them choose a username/subdomain (checking availability) and configure their profile. This requires multi-tenant support in our app (each subdomain serves different content) using wildcard DNS or dynamic routing.

Product Listings: Creators can list items for sale. These could be physical products (merchandise like T-shirts, mugs), digital products (e.g. e-books, presets, videos), or even services (shoutouts, coaching sessions). Each product entry has details like title, description, price, photos (or file attachment for digital goods), and possibly stock quantity for physical goods. In the MVP, we‚Äôll implement a simple product management CRUD interface on the creator‚Äôs dashboard.

Payments & Payouts: Payment processing must be integrated so fans can purchase products securely. We'll use a provider like Stripe for global payments (or Razorpay in India, as an option). The platform will process payments on behalf of influencers, deduct the commission, and then payout the remainder to the influencer. Using Stripe Connect (or a similar marketplace payment solution) will help onboard sellers and handle payouts at scale. For MVP, we can start by routing all payments to a platform account and manually tracking earnings, but long-term an automated split or payout system is ideal (Stripe Connect allows automatically routing funds minus fees to creators).

Social Media Integration: Since our users are influencers, the shops should integrate with their social presence. A nice-to-have is embedding their social feeds (Instagram posts, TikTok videos, YouTube streams) on the storefront or allowing easy sharing. MVP might simply allow linking out to socials, but we plan for features like auto-importing their profile picture or showcasing recent IG posts on their shop page via embedded widgets.

Customization: Creators should be able to personalize their storefront. At minimum, they can upload a logo or banner, choose theme colors, and write a bio/about section. This makes each shop feel unique. We‚Äôll design the frontend to support basic theming (maybe a few preset themes or just color/font changes in MVP).

Analytics Dashboard: An influencer dashboard will show stats like page views, product views, sales, and earnings. For MVP, we can track basic metrics (maybe total sales, number of orders, etc.). Using an analytics service like Plausible or a custom tracking solution can later provide insights on traffic sources and conversion rates.

Discount Codes & Promotions: Allow influencers to create promo codes (e.g. 10% off for their followers) to drive sales. This involves a simple discounts table and applying coupon logic at checkout. If this feels too much for MVP, it can be a later addition, but designing the database with a spot for ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù on orders is wise for future compatibility.

Customer Messaging or Q&A: To increase engagement, we could enable a way for shoppers to ask questions or message the creator (for example, inquiries about a product). This could be as simple as a contact form/email link initially. More advanced would be an in-app messaging or a discussion section per product (possibly a later feature due to complexity).

Order Management: Influencers need to see and manage their orders. The dashboard should list orders, including customer info (shipping address for physical goods), order status, and the ability to mark an order as fulfilled (or provide a download link for digital goods). For digital products, the system should automatically provide the buyer with a download link or email after purchase. For physical goods, the creator might handle shipping manually, so they need order details and perhaps shipping label generation in future.


These features ensure that the MVP is viable for real use: an influencer can sign up, customize a shop, list a product, share the link to followers, and accept orders with payment. Next, let's consider the technology stack to implement this efficiently.

üõ† Tech Stack Selection

Choosing the right tech stack is crucial for rapid development and scalability. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of each layer and recommended technologies:

Frontend: We can build the client-facing app using React (with a bundler like Vite for simplicity) or Next.js for a full-stack React framework. Next.js is appealing because it supports server-side rendering and file-based routing, which can be useful for handling dynamic subdomains and SEO for product pages. It also allows building API routes if needed. For our case, Next.js would work well to serve the storefront pages (which need SEO for product names) and possibly handle some backend logic via API routes.

Backend / API: If not using Next.js API routes for everything, we can create a separate backend service (Node.js based). A simple Express.js server or a more structured framework like NestJS (which has built-in module architecture and TypeORM integration) could manage the core API (auth, product CRUD, orders, etc.). For faster setup, Express with minimal middleware is fine for MVP. If we choose Next.js, we might not need a separate server for basic CRUD; however, for complex features (like webhooks from Stripe, or long-running processes) a separate Node service could be useful.

Database: PostgreSQL is a reliable choice for relational data (products, users, orders, etc.). We could use Supabase as a hosted Postgres solution with convenient APIs (Supabase also provides auth and storage which align with our needs). Supabase essentially gives a cloud Postgres DB with an ORM-like JavaScript client and can simplify some auth integration. Alternatively, any Postgres (or MySQL) instance works with traditional ORMs. We'll design tables for users, products, orders, etc. If using an ORM, options include Prisma or TypeORM for Node.

File Storage: For storing product images or digital downloads, use cloud storage. Supabase Storage integrates with their auth and offers an S3-like interface ‚Äì good if we go with Supabase. Otherwise, AWS S3 buckets (or similar like Google Cloud Storage) can store files, with URLs or signed URLs provided to the frontend. We need to allow influencers to upload images for product listings, and customers to download digital goods after purchase (ensuring only authorized buyers can access, perhaps via time-limited URLs).

Authentication: Supabase Auth is an easy choice if using Supabase ‚Äì it provides user management, email/password signup, and even social login if needed. It can save time by not having to implement password reset flows from scratch. Alternatively, Firebase Auth could do similarly. If using our own backend, implementing JWT-based auth with email/password is possible too, but third-party auth services reduce boilerplate. For MVP, email/password registration for influencers and just email for order confirmations (customers might not need full accounts to buy) is sufficient.

Payments: Stripe will be our primary payment gateway for global reach. It supports one-time payments, handles credit cards, Apple/Google Pay, etc., and crucially, Stripe Connect for marketplaces (onboarding multiple sellers and splitting payouts). We‚Äôll use Stripe‚Äôs API to create checkout sessions or integrate Stripe Elements for a custom checkout form. In markets like India, Razorpay can be an alternative or addition (as it handles local payment methods). Initially, implementing Stripe Checkout (hosted page) might be the fastest secure way to get payments running. The platform Stripe account will collect funds, which we later distribute to influencers (possibly via Connect Express accounts for automatic payout).

Deployment: We want an easy, scalable deployment. Vercel is great for Next.js apps (supporting custom domains and automatic SSL, which will help with our subdomain shops). If we have a separate backend, we could deploy on Fly.io (which can run full-stack Node apps close to users, with a free tier) or Render.com for simplicity. These platforms also support a Postgres add-on if not using Supabase. In any case, we need to handle wildcard subdomains on the hosting (Vercel supports wildcard domains configuration; if not, we can use a reverse proxy).

Subdomain & Routing: To serve each influencer‚Äôs shop on a subdomain, we‚Äôll likely use a wildcard DNS entry and route requests based on the host header. For example, a DNS CNAME *.platform.com pointing to our deployment means any username.platform.com hits our app. The app can parse the subdomain (username) from the request and load the appropriate data for that tenant. Optionally, using Cloudflare Workers + DNS API was suggested: this could dynamically create DNS records when a new shop is created, or handle edge routing. However, a wildcard domain with logic in our app is simpler for MVP. We just have to ensure our hosting allows a wildcard domain or use a proxy in front that does (Cloudflare proxy can direct all subdomains to our server with one DNS rule).

Analytics & Logging: For basic analytics, Plausible (a lightweight, privacy-friendly analytics tool) can be embedded to track page views on each shop. It could give the influencer insights without heavy setup. Additionally, we might set up our own event tracking (e.g., log every product view or purchase in a simple table for now). For error logging and monitoring, using something like Sentry or a simple logging to console/DB can help during development.


This stack emphasizes JavaScript/TypeScript across the board (React front-end, Node back-end), which means we can use a single language. It also aligns well with using AI coding assistants like Codex, which are very good at popular frameworks like React/Next and Node/Express. Next, we'll discuss the system design and how data will flow in this multi-tenant application.

üèó Architecture & Design Considerations

Designing a multi-tenant e-commerce platform for influencers involves planning how each creator‚Äôs data is isolated yet served from the same application instance. Here are the main design considerations:

1. Multi-Tenancy via Subdomains: Every influencer (tenant) will have their own subdomain storefront. We'll implement this by capturing the subdomain from incoming requests. For example, when a user visits alice.myplatform.com, our app determines alice is the shop identifier. In a Next.js app, we can use rewrites or custom server logic to handle subdomains, or simply read window.location.host on the client to know the subdomain. In an Express backend, middleware can parse req.hostname. We will store the subdomain (username) for each influencer in the database as a unique key. Using a wildcard DNS entry for *.myplatform.com pointing to our app means we don't need to manually set up DNS for each new user. Initially, we'll disallow characters that don't work in hostnames and ensure uniqueness during registration.

2. Data Models: We‚Äôll design a relational schema roughly as follows (in PostgreSQL):

Users table ‚Äì stores influencer account info: user_id, username (subdomain), email, password (hashed) or auth provider UID, display_name, bio, profile_image_url, theme_settings (colors, etc. as JSON).

Products table ‚Äì stores products listed by influencers: product_id, user_id (owner), name, description, price, currency, product_type (physical/digital/service), stock_quantity (if applicable), media_urls (maybe an array of image links or a single image for MVP), digital_file_url (if digital product file stored in S3/Supabase), is_active (for draft or removed products).

Orders table ‚Äì stores orders made by customers: order_id, product_id, seller_user_id, buyer_email (since we might not require account for buyer), quantity, total_amount, payment_status, order_status (e.g. pending, paid, fulfilled), created_at. We might also log a Stripe payment intent or session ID for verification, and perhaps a field for platform_fee and payout_amount. Each order essentially represents a sale of one product; if we want cart with multiple items, we'd need an Order table and an OrderItem table (with one-to-many relationship). For MVP, it might be simpler to restrict one product per checkout (or implement a basic cart).

(Optional) Customers table ‚Äì if we want buyers to have accounts or to track repeat customers, we could have a table for buyer info. MVP might not need this; capturing email and shipping address on each order could suffice.

(Optional) Discount Codes table ‚Äì code, description, discount_percent or amount, creator_user_id (so each influencer can have their own codes), expiration, etc. Order would then link to a discount if used.

(Optional) Messages/Chats ‚Äì if implementing messaging, a table for messages with fields (message_id, from_customer_email, to_influencer_id, content, timestamp) or similar. But this might be later feature.


All tables that contain user-specific data (products, orders, etc.) reference the user_id of the influencer to partition data by owner. This way, when we serve a subdomain site, we query e.g. SELECT * FROM products WHERE user_id = ... matching that influencer.

3. User Flows & Pages: Let‚Äôs break down the key user interfaces and how they interact with the backend:

Influencer Onboarding: A registration page for influencers to sign up. Fields: username (for subdomain), email, password. We‚Äôll check username uniqueness and valid characters. On submit, create a new user record. If using Supabase Auth, we might call their sign-up function which handles email verification if configured. After sign-up, the influencer can access their dashboard.

Influencer Dashboard (Web App for creators): This is an authenticated part of the site (likely served from a centralized domain like dashboard.myplatform.com or as part of the main site). Here creators manage their store:

Add/Edit Products: A form to create product entries (with fields as per product table, and an upload for image or file). For file uploads, we integrate with storage (Supabase storage or directly to S3 via pre-signed URL).

View Orders: A list of orders for their products. They should see customer info needed to fulfill (address for shipping or a note that it's a digital delivery). They can mark orders as fulfilled or add tracking info (for MVP, maybe just mark as done).

Dashboard Home: Summary stats (total sales, earnings after commission, maybe top products). Initially, this could be a simple aggregate query displayed.

Settings: Profile settings (display name, bio, profile picture upload, theme color pickers). Also, perhaps ability to connect a payout method (for payouts, Stripe Connect onboarding link).

Possibly a link or embed code for their social media (like ‚Äúadd this link to your Instagram bio‚Äù).


Shop Frontend (Public Storefront): This is what fans see at username.myplatform.com. It includes:

A homepage featuring the influencer‚Äôs branding (their banner, profile pic, bio) and product listings. Each product shows name, price, thumbnail, and link to its page.

A product detail page (perhaps username.myplatform.com/product/product-id or nice slug) which shows the full description, images, and a ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù button.

A checkout page or popup: For simplicity, when ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù is clicked, we can go directly to a checkout page for that product. The user (fan) enters their email, shipping info (if physical product), and payment details. We integrate Stripe here ‚Äì either via Stripe Checkout (redirect to Stripe‚Äôs hosted payment page) or an embedded card form. Using Stripe Checkout Session is easiest: our backend creates a Checkout Session via Stripe API including line item (product name, price, quantity) and success/cancel URLs. That way, we don‚Äôt have to handle card details at all. If successful, Stripe will webhook back to us to confirm payment.

After purchase, the customer sees an order confirmation page (perhaps hosted by us after Stripe redirects back). For digital goods, this page can show a download link (or it‚Äôs emailed). For physical, a thank-you message and order number is shown.


Payments & Commission Flow: When a customer pays (say $20 for a product), the money goes to the platform's Stripe account. We calculate our commission, e.g. 10% ($2), and the remainder ($18) is owed to the influencer. If using Stripe Connect with separate accounts for influencers, we could directly split the payment: Stripe allows setting a ‚Äúapplication fee‚Äù and route the rest to the seller‚Äôs Stripe account. For MVP, we might not set up Connect from day one; instead, simply record in our database that influencer X has $18 in earnings. We then periodically pay them out (could be manual via bank transfer or prompt them to input PayPal). Implementing Connect early is beneficial, though, since it automates compliance (tax forms, payouts to 100+ countries, etc., handled by Stripe). Connect will require onboarding flows (collecting bank info from influencers), which Stripe provides out-of-the-box UIs for. For now, we'll focus on at least capturing the data needed to calculate commissions on each order.

Scalability & Future Considerations: Our architecture will be monolithic for MVP (single database, single server handling all subdomains). This is fine initially. We should code with best practices (use environment variables for config, separate config files for keys, etc.). Later, if the platform grows, each shop‚Äôs heavy traffic could be handled by CDN caching or even extracting static pages (for mostly static content like product pages). Also, allowing custom domains (e.g. if an influencer wants shop.alice.com) would be a next step ‚Äì this complicates things with DNS and SSL but can be managed (most likely via an ACME DNS challenge or using Cloudflare to handle it).


In summary, the design centers on one web application serving multiple stores based on subdomain, a shared database with tenant isolation by user_id, and integration with third-party services (auth, storage, payments) to speed up development. With the design in mind, let's proceed to a step-by-step plan to build this platform.

üìñ Development Plan (Step-by-Step with AI Assistance)

We will now outline the sequence of tasks to develop the MVP. At each step, we‚Äôll note what needs to be built and how you can use Replit Ghostwriter or OpenAI Codex to accelerate development. The idea is to break the work into manageable pieces and leverage AI for boilerplate or suggestions. Always test the AI-generated code and refine as needed ‚Äì the AI is a fast coder, but you are the architect who ensures everything works correctly.

1. Set Up the Environment and Tools

Goal: Initialize the project repository, set up the development environment, and configure basic tooling.

Project Initialization: Start a new project on Replit (or your local machine). If using Next.js for frontend and backend, run npx create-next-app@latest to bootstrap a Next.js project (or use a Replit template for Next.js). If separating frontend and backend, create two Replit projects or two folders (one for a React app and one for an Express API). For simplicity, let's assume a unified Next.js app to begin with, as it can serve the frontend and provide API endpoints.

Version Control: If on Replit, you can link a GitHub repo or use Replit‚Äôs built-in git. It‚Äôs good to keep track of changes, especially when using AI to generate code.

Install Dependencies: Add necessary libraries:

For frontend: if using Next.js, most is built-in. Maybe install UI libraries or styling frameworks (could use Tailwind CSS for quick styling).

For backend/DB: If using Next.js API routes, install the database client (e.g., pg for Postgres or an ORM like Prisma or Sequelize). If separate Express server, set up express, cors, body-parser (or use Express's built-ins in recent versions), and ORM or query builder (like Knex.js) for DB.

Stripe SDK: npm install stripe for server-side and perhaps Stripe.js for client (if using client integration).

Supabase SDK: npm install @supabase/supabase-js if using Supabase for auth/storage.


Configuration: Set up a .env file for environment variables (Replit has a Secrets manager). You'll need to store things like the Database URL (for Postgres), Stripe API keys, and Supabase keys if used. On Replit, you might use their UI to add secrets, which populate environment vars.

Basic App Structure: Verify that the dev server runs. In Next.js, npm run dev should start it. If using Express, set it up to run on some port. At this stage, hitting the base URL should return the default Next.js page or a simple "Hello World" if Express. This confirms the environment is ready.


AI Assistance: At this setup stage, Codex can help by generating boilerplate configurations. For example, you can write a comment in a server file like // TODO: Setup Express server with CORS and JSON parsing and let the AI suggest the code. Or ask it to configure a basic Next.js custom server if needed. Codex is also helpful in writing configuration files (like a simple next.config.js for custom domain handling) based on natural language comments. Be specific about versions if needed (e.g., "use Express 4.x syntax").

2. Implement User Authentication & Onboarding

Goal: Enable influencers to register and log in to the platform, with a unique username that becomes their shop subdomain.

Database setup for users: Create the Users table in the database. If using Supabase, you can define the table in their web UI or via SQL. Essential fields as discussed (id, username, email, password_hash, etc.). If using Supabase Auth, a lot of this is managed by them (the auth.users table). But we might still keep a profiles table for extra info like username and display name.

User Registration (API): Implement an API endpoint for sign-up. In Next.js, create an API route file at pages/api/register.js (or .ts if TS) which accepts POST requests with email, username, password. In Express, create a /api/register route. This endpoint will:

Validate inputs (ensure username is alphanumeric and not taken, email valid, password strength perhaps).

If using Supabase Auth: call the supabase auth API to create a user (it handles password hashing and returns a user ID).

If custom auth: hash the password (using bcrypt) and insert a new row into Users table.

Store the username and other details in the DB. If Supabase, you might need to insert into a Profile table with the returned user ID.

Possibly send a verification email if needed (Supabase can auto-send confirmation emails, or we skip for MVP).

Respond with a success or error message.


User Login (API): Similarly, create a login endpoint (/api/login) to authenticate. If using Supabase Auth, you‚Äôd call supabase‚Äôs signIn function (which returns a token or session). If custom, check the email/password against the DB (compare hash) and issue a JWT if valid. For simplicity, using Supabase or another managed auth can save time here.

Also, consider session management: Next.js API routes or Express can set a cookie with a JWT or just return the token to be stored in client (e.g., localStorage). We should secure the dashboard routes so only logged-in users (influencers) can access them.


Username/Subdomain reservation: The registration process must ensure each username is unique, as it will be used in the subdomain. After a successful registration, you may want to immediately configure the routing for that subdomain. If using wildcard DNS, nothing to change at DNS level. If using Cloudflare API to add a DNS record for the subdomain, you could call it here, but with wildcard this is unnecessary.

Replit (or Dev) Testing: At this point, test the registration flow. Using Replit, you can run the project and use the Replit webview or open in a browser tab. Try creating a user via the API (maybe using a tool like curl or Replit's built-in HTTP client if available). Ensure the record appears in the DB and that no duplicate usernames are allowed.


AI Assistance: You can use Codex to scaffold these routes. For example, in an Express router file, write a comment like // POST /api/register - validate input, hash password, save user and trigger the AI to fill it in. Ensure to provide context (import statements for bcrypt, db client, etc. in the file so the AI knows what to use). Codex might produce a complete function with error handling, which you can then adjust. Always double-check security aspects (like using parameterized queries or ORM to avoid SQL injection, properly hashing passwords). Codex can also help write the SQL migration for creating tables if you prompt it (e.g., -- SQL: Create table users ...). Keep prompts focused on one task at a time for best results.

3. Creator Dashboard Skeleton

Goal: Create the basic structure for the influencer‚Äôs dashboard where they will manage their shop. We won't flesh out all functionality yet, but set up the protected routes and navigation.

Dashboard Routing: If using Next.js, we might have a folder like pages/dashboard with subpages for different sections (e.g., dashboard/index.js, dashboard/products.js, dashboard/orders.js, etc.). We need to protect these pages so only logged-in users see them. One approach: when a page loads, check if a user session exists (maybe via a context provider or by calling an auth API). If not, redirect to login.

Alternatively, implement this in the frontend by storing an auth token and checking on each page. For MVP, a simple check in useEffect that redirects if no token is present works.


Dashboard Layout: Create a simple React layout with a sidebar or menu for navigation (e.g., "Products", "Orders", "Settings"). On Replit or with Codex help, you can quickly generate a responsive menu. Using a UI library or premade component (like Chakra UI or Material-UI) can speed up styling.

Placeholder Pages: Implement stub pages/components for:

Products Management: A page that later will list products and have a button ‚ÄúAdd Product‚Äù.

Orders: A page that will list orders.

Settings/Profile: Page for editing profile or payout info. For now, these can just say "No products yet" or "No orders yet" to ensure routing works.


Test login flow to dashboard: After building this skeleton, test the end-to-end: Register a new user, log in (you might store the token or session in localStorage or cookie), then navigate to /dashboard. Ensure you see the dashboard UI. Without login, manually check that navigating to dashboard gets denied or redirected (this requires adding that logic).


AI Assistance: Codex can assist in creating React components and even entire pages. You could prompt it with something like: // React component for a dashboard sidebar with links to Products, Orders, Settings and it can output a JSX component. It can also help with Next.js authentication logic if you ask: "Next.js API route for checking JWT and returning user profile". A tip is to give the AI enough context (e.g., mention we use JWT or Supabase session) so it knows how to structure the auth check. Use it to generate repetitive or boilerplate elements (like forms, tables) by describing them in comments.

4. Product Creation & Management

Goal: Enable influencers to add new products and list their existing products on the dashboard.

Product Form (Frontend): On the "Add Product" page (or modal), create a form for product details: name, description, price, etc., and an image upload. In React, manage form state or use a form library. For image upload, you can integrate with Supabase storage or directly with an API endpoint:

If Supabase: you can use their JavaScript client to upload a file to a storage bucket. This returns a URL or path you can store.

Alternatively, build an API route like /api/upload that accepts a file (using form-data). For simplicity, using Supabase‚Äôs built-in upload from the browser might be easiest (it handles the HTTP PUT to the storage).


Create Product (API): Build an API route (/api/products/new for example) that handles the form submission. It should:

Authenticate the request (ensure the user is logged in ‚Äì possibly by checking a token or session cookie).

Receive the product data (and possibly a URL/path of the uploaded image if the front-end already handled uploading).

Insert a new row in the Products table with the provided data and user_id of the creator.

Return success or the created product info. For Next.js, that would be in pages/api/products.js or similar; for Express, an endpoint in the router.


List Products (Frontend): On the dashboard "Products" page, fetch the list of products for the logged-in influencer. Create a useEffect to call /api/products?user_id=me (or the API can infer user from session). Display the products in a table or grid with basic info (name, price, maybe an edit/delete button).

Implement delete product (API route to delete by id, only if it belongs to the authenticated user).

Implement edit product if needed (similar to add, but pre-fill form and update record on submit).


Validation & Errors: Make sure to handle validation (e.g., price must be a positive number, name not empty). Show error messages on the form if the API returns an error. This is part of providing a good UX.


AI Assistance: Use Codex to generate the product form component by describing the fields needed. For instance, // Form with fields: name (text), price (number), description (textarea), file upload ‚Äì the AI can scaffold this in JSX. It might also help with writing the API logic: comment // Insert new product into database and let it write the SQL or ORM code. If using Prisma, for example, you can have it generate a Prisma schema for the Product model from your description. Codex can also create dummy data for testing by writing a small script or a seed function if prompted (could be useful to populate a few products to see the UI).

5. Public Storefront Pages (Shop Front)

Goal: Create the public-facing pages that fans will see when visiting an influencer‚Äôs shop URL, and allow them to view products and initiate purchases.

Shop Home Page: This page is served at username.myplatform.com (the root of the subdomain). It should fetch the influencer‚Äôs profile (name, bio, profile pic, theme colors) and their list of products. We can implement this in Next.js as [username]/index.js dynamic route (Next.js supports catch-all or dynamic routes for subdomains if configured ‚Äì alternatively, use a custom server in Node to map subdomains to a Next.js page). Simpler: configure Next.js to treat the first subpath as the user (like /[username]), but that normally expects URL path, not subdomain. Another approach is to use a wildcard domain that passes the subdomain as ctx.query in getInitialProps via some custom server logic. For MVP, if this is complex, we could cheat by using paths instead of subdomains (e.g., myplatform.com/username for now) while keeping the architecture ready for subdomains. However, since subdomains are a key feature, let's assume we set up wildcard domain and Next.js custom server to handle it.

The Shop page will display the influencer‚Äôs banner or name at top, their bio, and then a grid of product items. Each product item links to its detail page.


Product Detail Page: At URL username.myplatform.com/product/[id] (or [slug]). This shows a larger product image, description, price, and a Buy button. If the product is a digital download, maybe label it as such (so user knows they'll get a file). If physical, perhaps show an "Ships to" or a note if limited.

Fetch Data: These pages can use Next.js data fetching (e.g., getServerSideProps) to fetch data from the database on each request, using the subdomain/username to query the right products. Or use client-side fetch on mount. Server-side rendering is better for SEO (search engines indexing influencer shops).

Write a function to resolve the subdomain to a user: e.g., strip the .myplatform.com from the hostname to get username, then query the Users table for that username. If not found, return 404.

Then fetch that user‚Äôs products from Products table.

Pass this data to the React page to render.


Styling: Apply the user‚Äôs theme customizations: if they chose a color scheme, use those colors for buttons/background, etc. This can be inline styles or a CSS class generated from their settings. Keep the design clean and mobile-friendly (a lot of fans will come from Instagram on mobile browsers).

Social Links: On the shop page, include icons/links to the influencer‚Äôs social media (we can store a few social URLs in the user profile if they provided any in settings).

Testing: Create a dummy user with a couple of products via the dashboard, then try to access the shop page via its subdomain (in dev, it might be tricky to simulate subdomain locally without editing hosts file; using a deployed or a tool like xip.io or lvh.me could help. On Replit, each project gets a domain like projectusername.repl.co, not sure if subdomains can be dynamic there. If not, using path-based might be necessary in dev and trust that wildcard works in production).


AI Assistance: Codex can help generate the Next.js data fetching logic. For example, write a comment in your [username].js page: // TODO: fetch user and products from DB based on subdomain ‚Äì it might output a sample getServerSideProps function using an ORM or SQL. Ensure to adjust it to your actual DB library and error handling. For the UI, you can describe the layout: // A React component that displays a banner, bio, and a list of products with image, name, price and let it produce JSX. You might have to guide it to use your CSS classes or Tailwind if you set that up. Also, use AI to quickly create placeholder images or figure out a layout using flexbox/CSS grid by asking for it in a comment (it often knows common Tailwind classes or CSS needed for a grid of cards, for example).

6. Checkout & Payment Integration

Goal: Allow customers to purchase a product via the shop, process payment through Stripe, and record the order.

Stripe Setup: Configure your Stripe account and get API keys (test keys for dev). Decide if you will use Stripe Checkout (a hosted solution) or a custom card form. We‚Äôll go with Stripe Checkout for MVP because it handles all payment UI, security, and even things like Apple Pay automatically.

In Stripe Dashboard, set up products/prices? Actually, since our products are dynamic and managed in our DB, we don't necessarily use Stripe's product catalog. Instead, we create ad-hoc Checkout Sessions for each purchase with line items specifying the price.

Enable webhooks in Stripe dashboard to listen for checkout completion events (e.g., checkout.session.completed).


Checkout Session API: Implement an API route like /api/checkout-session. When the fan clicks "Buy" on a product page, our frontend will call this API (or navigate to a Next.js page that triggers it via getServerSideProps). The server-side will:

Accept the product ID and perhaps quantity (MVP could default to 1).

Look up the product info (ensure it's a valid, active product).

Create a Stripe Checkout Session via the Stripe SDK call stripe.checkout.sessions.create({...}), providing details such as:

payment_method_types (cards, etc.),

line_items: an array with the product name, quantity, and price. (We can use the product's price from DB; Stripe expects an amount in cents and currency).

mode: 'payment' (for one-time payments).

success_url and cancel_url: URLs on our site to redirect after payment success or cancellation. For success, maybe to a /[username]/order-confirmation?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}.

metadata: we can attach metadata like the productId and sellerId to the session, so we know later which product was bought and who the seller is.

payment_intent_data: here we can specify application_fee_amount for commission if using Connect and a transfer_data[destination] to the influencer‚Äôs Stripe account. For MVP without Connect, skip this; money goes all to platform account.


Return the session ID or (in case of Next.js using getServerSideProps, simply redirect to session.url).

On the client, use Stripe.redirectToCheckout({ sessionId }) if not already redirected.


Webhook for Payment Success: After a successful payment, Stripe will send a webhook event to our backend (if we set it up). Since receiving webhooks on a dev server is tricky, during development you can poll the session status or use the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks. But for MVP, let's implement a webhook handler (e.g., /api/webhook in Next.js or a route in Express) to process events:

Verify the event‚Äôs signature (Stripe provides a signing secret for webhook security).

On checkout.session.completed, retrieve the session (it contains the metadata we added, or the PaymentIntent with details).

Record an Order in our database: mark it paid, store buyer email (the session contains customer details if provided), store the amount, product, and link to the influencer (seller).

If digital product, we could generate a unique download link or mark it available to download.

Potentially, send a confirmation email to the buyer (Stripe can handle basic receipts, but custom email could include download link or contact info). Email service like SendGrid can be integrated later; for MVP perhaps skip email or use Stripe's receipt.


Order Confirmation Page: After payment, the user is redirected to our site. We can have a Next.js page for order confirmation ([username]/order-confirmation.js) that uses the session_id in query to fetch details via Stripe API or our database:

It can call our backend to get the Order by session ID (if we stored the session ID in DB when creating the order on webhook).

Or simpler, use stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve(sessionId) on the server side of that page to get session info and display a basic confirmation (like "Thank you, your purchase of X is confirmed! Check your email for details.").

If it's a digital product, provide the download link (which could be a link to an API route like /api/download?orderId=XYZ that checks if the request has access to that order and then streams the file from storage).


Testing Payment Flow: Use Stripe test mode with a test card (4242 4242 4242 4242...). Run through a purchase: from product page, click buy, go to Stripe checkout (in test mode), do the payment, and see if the order appears in DB and confirmation works. Adjust any issues (e.g., if webhook processing lags, maybe the confirmation page should handle case where order isn‚Äôt saved yet).


AI Assistance: Codex can significantly speed up writing Stripe integration code. For instance, you can prompt: // Use stripe.checkout.sessions.create to make a checkout session for amount X and it will often write the correct API call structure. It knows common Stripe patterns, but double-check the API version and parameters. For webhooks, you can comment // Express webhook endpoint to handle Stripe events and get a starter code (be sure to insert your signing secret and use Stripe‚Äôs library to verify signatures). Codex may even generate code to parse the event types. Also, for the confirmation page, you can ask it to format a nice message or handle the logic of retrieving session info in Next.js. Always test the suggestions with Stripe‚Äôs docs if unsure, as payment code is crucial to get right.

7. Order Management for Influencers

Goal: Provide the influencer a view of incoming orders and the ability to manage them (mark shipped, etc.).

Order Database Revisited: By now, we should have Orders being recorded (via webhook). If not, we need to ensure we create order entries somewhere. Possibly, we create the order in the webhook after payment. Alternatively, one could create an "order pending" when checkout initiated and update it on payment success. For simplicity, assume webhook creates the final order record.

API Endpoint to List Orders: Implement /api/my-orders for authenticated influencers. It will query Orders where seller_user_id = current user‚Äôs ID, join with Products table to get product names or IDs. Possibly include relevant fields like buyer email, amount, status.

Dashboard Orders Page: In the creator dashboard (from step 3, the Orders section), fetch from /api/my-orders and display a list. Show key info: order date, product name, buyer (at least email), price paid, status. If physical product, maybe show shipping address (where to ship to). If we captured address in Stripe Checkout, that info is available in the Checkout Session (shipping details) or the PaymentIntent. We might need to store shipping info in the Order record via the webhook (Stripe‚Äôs event contains shipping address if we enabled that collection).

Order Actions: Allow influencer to update an order‚Äôs status. For MVP, maybe just a "Mark as Fulfilled" button. This would call an API like /api/orders/[id]/fulfill (PUT request), which updates the order status to "fulfilled" (and maybe timestamp). This helps the influencer keep track. If we had email integration, marking fulfilled could trigger a "your order has shipped" email to buyer ‚Äì but that can be an enhancement.

Payout Calculations: The dashboard might also show the influencer how much they earned (perhaps total of all orders minus commission). We could calculate sum of all orders‚Äô payout_amount for that user. If implementing payouts, the status of payout (pending/paid) could be tracked, but for MVP, just showing earnings is enough. Possibly have a note: "Payouts are processed monthly" or similar until automated.

Testing: Make a test order by going through checkout as a customer for one of the influencer‚Äôs products. Then login as that influencer and confirm the order appears in their dashboard.


AI Assistance: Codex can help in constructing SQL or ORM queries to get the orders. If using an ORM, something like: // Fetch all orders for user X with product details might yield a code snippet. For updating status, you can have it generate the handler function. In terms of frontend, have it generate a simple table component for orders using a comment prompt describing the columns needed.

8. Influencer Store Customization

Goal: Let influencers personalize their storefront (at least minimally).

Profile Settings: On the Settings page of the dashboard, add fields for things like display name (shop title), bio/description, and maybe color choices or a banner image upload.

Profile API: Create an endpoint (e.g., /api/update-profile) that allows a user to update their profile info (and store it in the Users table). If uploading images (profile pic or banner), handle those similar to product images (upload to storage, save URL).

Apply Customizations: Ensure the public shop pages use these settings:

Display the influencer‚Äôs display name (instead of username) as the shop title.

Show their bio on the homepage.

If a banner image URL exists, show that at top of page.

Use their chosen theme color for headers/buttons. This might involve injecting a <style> or CSS variables when rendering the page. For example, store a hex color in DB, and on the page, set that as --theme-color in a style tag, which your CSS references for theming.


Preview: Optionally, the influencer might want to preview how their shop looks after changes. If changes are saved and immediately affect the subdomain site (and if they're on the same domain logged in, they can just refresh their shop to see it), that could be enough. Or provide a link "View my shop" in the dashboard.

Social Links in Profile: Add fields for social media URLs (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok) and store them. Then update the shop page to show icons linking to these, if present. This further ties the shop to their social identity.


AI Assistance: Use AI to help with image upload handling (it can write a routine to handle an <input type="file"> change event and send to server or Supabase). Also, generating CSS for a dynamic theme can be tricky; you could describe in a comment what you want (e.g., // CSS: use a variable --theme-color for background of .header) and it might output a snippet. If using Tailwind, you might let AI configure a custom color in the Tailwind config via a prompt. Essentially, AI can handle the boilerplate of reading a file to base64 or adding an event listener, etc., saving you time.

9. Polishing and Testing the MVP

Goal: Before deployment, refine the app by fixing bugs, ensuring security, and improving the UI/UX basics.

Input Validation & Security: Double-check all API routes to ensure they validate inputs and protect against unauthorized access:

Any API that modifies data (products, orders, profile) should require authentication and only allow the owner to affect their data. For example, one influencer shouldn‚Äôt be able to edit another‚Äôs product by changing an ID. Implement checks like where user_id = currentUser in queries.

Use parameterized queries or ORM to avoid SQL injection. If using raw SQL via Supabase or node-postgres, ensure you parameterize values.

If using JWT for auth, ensure sensitive routes verify the token signature and ideally use a middleware to set req.user. If using Supabase, ensure the JWT secret is correctly set (Supabase can provide a JWT for the client which you can decode).

Sanitize any output that might be rendered (to avoid XSS). E.g., if influencers write product descriptions, we might allow basic HTML or markdown in future, but for now maybe plain text to be safe.


Responsive Design: Test the UI on mobile dimensions. Ensure the shop page product grid wraps nicely on a small screen, the dashboard is usable on mobile (though creators might mostly use desktop, some will use mobile). Adjust CSS as needed (AI can help with specific CSS issues if asked).

Testing Flows: Simulate all flows:

New user signup -> create product -> share link -> visit link as guest -> buy product -> complete payment -> see order in dashboard.

Try edge cases: buying with invalid card (Stripe test will show failure, see if our app handles cancel gracefully), registration with taken username, etc.

Test what happens if an influencer tries a feature they shouldn‚Äôt (like editing someone else‚Äôs data via API call ‚Äì should be forbidden).


Performance Consideration: For MVP on a small scale, our approach should perform fine. With few products per influencer, queries are light. However, consider adding basic indexes in the DB (e.g., index on user_id for Products and Orders tables since we query by those often). If using Supabase, it‚Äôs Postgres under the hood, so we can add indexes via SQL.

Commission Calculation: Ensure when recording orders, you calculate the commission and store the net amount for the influencer. For instance, if platform fee is 10%, on a $100 order store maybe platform_fee=10, creator_earning=90. This way the math is transparent for payouts. You might include these in the Orders table or compute on the fly for the dashboard.

Payout Process: Although not fully implementing automated payouts in MVP, have a plan or at least a note for manual payout. For instance, you could have a simple page listing total earnings and a button "Request Payout" that sends you (the admin) a notification. Or instruct creators that payouts are done monthly. Setting expectations is important so creators trust the platform. Eventually, integrating Stripe Connect to automatically payout to creators‚Äô bank accounts would be ideal (Stripe Connect can hold funds and pay out on schedule, and handle generating 1099 forms for US, etc. which is complex to do yourself).


AI Assistance: At this polishing stage, AI can help by acting as a rubber duck for code review. You can paste a function and ask "Any potential security issues here?" and it might flag something like missing auth or unsanitized inputs. There‚Äôs also the Replit Explain Code or Improve Code features that could refactor or highlight issues. Use the AI to generate tests if you want (it can generate unit test skeletons for your APIs if you prompt it, though setting up a test runner might be extra work not critical for MVP). For CSS responsiveness issues, describe the problem and desired outcome, the AI often can suggest correct flexbox or grid usage.

10. Deployment and Domains

Goal: Deploy the application to a production environment where real users can access it on your domain.

Choose a Host: If using Next.js, Vercel is a strong choice. You can import the project from GitHub to Vercel and it will deploy automatically. Vercel supports wildcard subdomains: you can add *.myplatform.com in your domain settings. Alternatively, Fly.io can host a Node app (you‚Äôd use a Dockerfile). Supabase is hosting the DB and auth if we went that route, so ensure the frontend uses the production Supabase project credentials.

Environment Vars: Set the production environment variables on the host (Stripe keys, DB URL, etc.). Double-check that in production you use the live Stripe keys (or test keys if not live yet, but then you can only test).

DNS Setup: Point your domain to the hosting:

If Vercel, you likely add a CNAME myplatform.com to alias. For wildcard, you set *.myplatform.com CNAME to Vercel as well (or an A record depending on instructions). Vercel will issue a wildcard SSL cert so that all subdomains are served securely.

If you have a separate backend domain (not likely if using Next on Vercel), handle that accordingly.


Testing in Prod: After deploying, create a new influencer account on the live site, add a product, and visit the live subdomain page. It should load with HTTPS and everything. Test a purchase with Stripe in test mode if the site is not public yet, or small real transaction if live (you can always refund).

Monitoring: Set up some basic monitoring or logs. Vercel shows function logs for API routes. You might want to get notified on errors ‚Äì consider adding Sentry for error tracking if desired (can be easily added in Next.js). Also, monitor the database usage on Supabase or DB host to ensure no abnormal spikes.

Beta Launch: Initially, maybe invite a couple of friendly influencer friends to test opening a shop, get feedback. They might spot UX issues or desire features like custom domain support or more analytics, which you can prioritize next.


AI Assistance: Deployment isn‚Äôt directly something Codex does, but it can help with writing any server config or Dockerfile if needed. For example, if using Fly.io, you might ask it for a Dockerfile for a Next.js app or how to configure wildcard domain on Nginx if that was needed. Documentation lookup is key here (the AI may have seen such info, but always verify with host docs). Essentially, you can consult the AI like "How do I set up wildcard domains on Vercel?" ‚Äì sometimes it gives correct guidance (like adding a wildcard DNS record and domain in Vercel settings) which you can confirm on Vercel‚Äôs docs.

ü§ñ Leveraging Replit Ghostwriter & Codex Effectively

Throughout the development process, AI coding assistants can significantly speed up your work. Here are some tips on using Replit‚Äôs Ghostwriter (which uses Codex/GPT under the hood) to help build this project:

Write Clear Comments/Prompts: The AI is triggered by comments or direct prompts. Describe the desired code precisely. For example, in a Python context Ghostwriter understood # sort a list of tuples by the second element and generated the correct code. In our case, you might write in a Node file: // Express route to handle Stripe webhook, verifying signature and parsing event ‚Äì Ghostwriter can then output a code snippet that uses Stripe‚Äôs library to accomplish this. The key is to mention specifics (e.g., "verifying signature" so it knows to use the stripe.webhooks.constructEvent method).

One Task at a Time: Break down prompts to focus on one function or component at a time. Instead of asking the AI to build the entire product page, ask for a piece (like "fetch data for product detail page" or "React component for displaying product details"). This modular approach yields more accurate code and makes it easier to verify each part.

Leverage Autocomplete: Ghostwriter will suggest code as you type (especially common patterns). For instance, as you start writing a SQL query or a React useEffect, it may complete it for you. Keep an eye on these inline suggestions ‚Äì they can often save typing boilerplate (like form handlers or try/catch blocks). Press Tab to accept suggestions that look correct.

Use the AI Chat (Replit Assistant): If you're stuck on a bug or need an explanation, Replit‚Äôs AI chat can be useful. You might ask "Why is my Stripe webhook handler not working?" and paste the error message; the AI might diagnose the issue (e.g., missing raw body handling for Stripe webhooks, which is a common gotcha). The chat can also generate code on demand ‚Äì e.g., ‚ÄúShow me a Next.js getServerSideProps example that reads a subdomain from context‚Äù ‚Äì which can give insight or starting code.

Quality Assurance: Always review and test AI-generated code. While Ghostwriter is powerful and often correct, it's not infallible. Logic errors or security oversights can slip in. Treat the AI‚Äôs output as a draft that you refine. For complex logic (like commission calculation or multi-step processes), add your own unit tests or manually simulate to ensure correctness.

Learning from AI: Ghostwriter can serve as a learning tool. When it writes something you didn‚Äôt know how to do (say, a clever SQL query or a new library method), take a moment to understand the code. This deepens your knowledge for future tasks. It's like having an expert pair-programmer ‚Äì but you get to decide if the code is up to standards.


By integrating AI assistance into your workflow, you effectively accelerate development by focusing on higher-level logic while the AI handles routine coding patterns. Many creators report that such tools make them significantly more productive, allowing them to focus on building features rather than boilerplate. In this project, Ghostwriter can help transform natural-language ideas (your prompts) directly into code, making the development process more about orchestrating and verifying code rather than writing every line by hand.

üí∞ Monetization Model

A key aspect of this platform is that it‚Äôs free for influencers to get started ‚Äì we monetize via commissions on sales. Let‚Äôs briefly recap and detail how this will work and be tracked:

Commission Rate: For MVP, we can set a flat commission, say 10% per transaction (or a range 5‚Äì10% as we consider). This means if an influencer sells a $50 item, the platform earns $5, the influencer gets $45. This rate could be adjusted depending on product type or volume, but start simple. (Notably, existing creator commerce platforms use similar or even smaller fees ‚Äì for example, Fourthwall charges ~3% on digital products, but they also profit from fulfillment of physical goods. Since our platform might not handle fulfillment, a slightly higher rate could be justified.)

Fee Implementation: Using Stripe, if we adopt Connect with separate accounts, we can directly take the fee during the transaction. Stripe allows an application_fee_amount parameter and transfers the rest to the seller. If not using Connect initially, we simply take full payment to our platform account, then later manually pay creators their share. In the database, each Order can have fields for platform_fee and creator_amount as mentioned. This makes accounting transparent.

Payouts to Influencers: Initially, we might do payouts manually (e.g., via PayPal or bank transfer offline) on a schedule (weekly or upon request). It‚Äôs good to clarify in the influencer dashboard how and when they get paid (maybe a note: "You will receive payouts of your earnings via PayPal at the beginning of each month"). As soon as feasible, automating this with Stripe Connect Express accounts is ideal ‚Äì Stripe will handle depositing to their bank. The platform would then periodically invoke payouts (or Stripe can auto-payout on a schedule). Important: Ensure compliance with any tax or financial regulations ‚Äì e.g., in US, issuing 1099-K forms if creators earn over a threshold. Stripe can offload much of this compliance when using Connect.

Premium Features Upsell: While the core offering is free (commission-based), consider offering premium subscriptions in the future. For example, a monthly fee that unlocks advanced features:

Use of a custom domain (so the influencer can use mycoolshop.com instead of a subdomain) ‚Äì this involves custom DNS and SSL handling, which we can support as an upgrade.

More in-depth analytics or integrations (e.g., integration with Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel).

Removal of platform branding ("Powered by MyPlatform" badge) from their shop.

Priority support or early access to new features.


These can provide additional revenue streams beyond commissions. However, for MVP, these are not implemented; we just keep them in mind for the roadmap.

Cost Structure: Running the platform will have some costs ‚Äì hosting, database, storage, and especially payment processing fees. Stripe charges ~2.9% + 30¬¢ per transaction (which either the platform eats or passes to sellers). We should factor that into the 10% commission (effectively net ~7% after payment fees, depending on volume). Supabase has a free tier up to certain limits and modest pricing after. Our commission should cover these costs at scale. Starting lean (maybe just one server, and incremental costs per user mostly from Stripe fees) means we can support initial users without charging them until they start selling.
